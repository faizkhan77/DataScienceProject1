Bangalore House Price Prediction

Welcome to the Bangalore House Price Prediction project repository! This project involves the analysis and prediction of house prices in Bangalore using a machine learning model. The entire workflow includes data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, deployment using Django, and a user-friendly frontend.

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices in Bangalore based on various features such as square footage, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and location. The workflow can be summarized into the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Data on Bangalore houses has been collected and stored for analysis. The dataset contains information about different houses in Bangalore.

2. **Data Cleaning:** The data collected may have inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers. The cleaning process involves using Pandas to preprocess the data, ensuring it is ready for analysis.

3. **Feature Engineering:** The dataset may be enriched by creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

4. **One-Hot Encoding:** Categorical variables are often one-hot encoded to make them suitable for machine learning models.

5. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or other methods are employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving relevant information.

6. **Model Training:** Different machine learning models are trained using the scikit-learn library. GridSearchCV is utilized to find the best hyperparameters for each model.

7. **Export Model:** Once the optimal model is identified, it is exported as a pickle file for later use.

8. **Django Server:** A Django server is created to handle API calls. The trained model is integrated into the server to provide predictions based on user input.

9. **Frontend UI:** An interactive user interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input details such as square footage, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and location to get predictions on house prices.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data exploration, cleaning, and model training steps.
- `models/`: Stores the exported machine learning model in pickle format.
- `django_server/`: Django server code for handling API requests and integrating the machine learning model.
- `frontend/`: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.
